              <p class="font1">In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert information—such as a 
                  er, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for communication through a 
                  communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is an invention of language, which enabled a 
                  person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard, or felt to others. But speech limits the range of 
                  communication to the distance a voice can carry and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered. The 
                  invention of writing, which converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across 
                  nd time.
                The process of encoding converts information from a source into symbols for communication or storage. Decoding is the 
                reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands, such as English or/and Spanish.
                 One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language, spoken or written, is
                 difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or the arms of a 
                 semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters, and numbers. Another person standing a 
                 great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.
                 A cable code replaces words (e.g. ship or invoice) with shorter words, allowing the same information to be sent with fewer 
                 characters, more quickly, and less expensively.
                 Codes can be used for brevity. When telegraph messages were the state of the art in rapid long-distance communication,
                 ate systems of commercial codes that encoded complete phrases into single mouths (commonly five-minute groups) were 
                 developed, so that telegraphers became conversant with such "words" as BYOXO ("Are you trying to weasel out of our 
                 deal?"), LIOUY ("Why do you not answer my question?"), BMULD ("You're a skunk!"), or AYYLU ("Not clearly coded, 
                 repeat more clearly."). Code words were chosen for various reasons: length, pronounceability, etc. Meanings were chosen 
                 to fit perceived needs: commercial negotiations, military terms for military codes, diplomatic terms for diplomatic codes, 
                 any and all of the preceding for espionage codes. Codebooks and codebook publishers proliferated, including one run as a 
                 front for the American Black Chamber run by Herbert Yardley between the First and Second World Wars. The purpose of most of 
                 these codes was to save on cable costs. The use of data coding for data compression predates the computer era; an early 
                 example is the telegraph Morse code where more-frequently used characters have shorter representations. Techniques such as 
                 Huffman coding are now used by computer-based algorithms to compress large data files into a more compact form for storage 
                 or transmission.</p>
