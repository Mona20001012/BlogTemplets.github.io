              <h1>Bloggers in Heaven</h1>
              <p>Just because somebody has something (tons of friends, a million dollars, a bitchin’ beach body) doesn’t necessarily 
                  mean that person is confident in it. There are business tycoons who lack confidence in their own wealth, models who 
                  lack confidence in their looks, and celebrities who lack confidence in their own popularity. So I think the first 
                  thing we can establish is that confidence is not necessarily linked to any external marker. Rather, our confidence is
                   rooted in our perception of ourselves, regardless of any tangible external reality.</p>

That YOU’RE the problem, basically.Which to their credit, maybe their ideal student isn’t doing what they need to do. But that doesn’t mean that’s the only reason they aren’t succeeding.

A party will typically feature food and beverages, and often music and dancing or other forms of entertainment. In many Western countries, parties for teens and adults are associated with drinking alcohol such as beer, wine, or distilled spirits.
                        More occasionally (though often in politics), a party can also simply refer to a group of people with a common objective.</h3></a>
