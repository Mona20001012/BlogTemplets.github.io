This paper focuses on the research-oriented, as opposed to the practically-oriented, translation program. We argue that computer studies in such a program should prepare students for research at either the receiving or production ends of machine translation systems, both of which require linguistic, computational and translational expertise</h3></a>

                   It stands to reason that the faster you can type, the more time you will save.Everyone is looking for ways to be more productive both in the workplace and at home, and typing faster is a simple way to get more done.
                   If you learn to double the speed you type, you can essentially get twice as much done in the same space of time.</h3></a>

ML applications learn from experience (well data) like humans without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. In other words, with Machine Learning, computers find insightful information without being told where to look. Instead, they do this by leveraging algorithms that learn from data in an iterative process.</h3></a>
